# Project in Computational Data Analysis

The purpose of this project was to find relations between sales, chains, catchment and geography by :

- Finding patterns in the relations between the revenues of the various categories of
products sold at the Danish pharmacies;
- Combining those results with the population demographics related to the bricks,
regions, chains and pharmacies;
- Classifying the pharmacies and predicting the surroundings of one given pharmacy.

Very strong relationships were found between medecine needs and geography (Metropolis, Suburbs, Larger provincial city, Smaller provincial city, Countryside).
